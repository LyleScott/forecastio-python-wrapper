forecastio-wrapper
==================

A Python wrapper for the [forcastio API service](https://forecast.io).

THIS LIBRARY STILL IN DEVELOPMENT. NOT AT ALL READY FOR CONSUMPTION.


Goal
----

Create a simple API that follows the
[forecast.io development docs nomenclature](https://developer.forecast.io).
I don't really plan to do anything fancy, but I do want to make sure this
API is super simple, straightforward, and performant.
